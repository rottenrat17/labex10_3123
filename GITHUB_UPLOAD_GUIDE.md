### Source Code:
- ✅ `src/` folder (all files)
- ✅ `public/` folder (all files)
- ✅ `package.json`

- ✅ `.gitignore`

### Total files to upload:

## ❌ DO NOT UPLOAD:

- ❌ Helper markdown files (ASSIGNMENT_CHECKLIST.md, FINAL_CHECK.md, etc.)

## 📋 Quick Upload Steps:

1. **Make sure .gitignore is updated** (already done)

2. **Initialize git and push:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Lab Exercise 10 - React Redux and JWT Demo"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/rottenrat17/labex10_3123.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Verify on GitHub:**

     - src/ folder
     - public/ folder
     - package.json
     - .gitignore
